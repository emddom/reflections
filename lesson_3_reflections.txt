When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When I want to collaborate with someone else.
    Also when I want to be able to edit code from multiple different
    computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the computers.
    It can also serve as a backup.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Clone: when I want to use and also update a repository
	Branch: when I want to work on something else in an existing repository.
